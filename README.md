# Hello!

This repo demonstrates my coding ability in Python. There are 3 main files:

* `well commented.py`
* `without comments.py`
* `kernel_style.py`

There is a `current.py` which is just a copy of one of them, you can replace `current.py` with a copy of one of the above.
The test harness `testpy.py` will run `current.py`

## To run:

simply type:

>`python testpy.py` 


I tested it on windows.

## Output

Running the above command will run `current.py` against the dictionary, print the results, and time how long it took!

Happy coding in Python. :)
